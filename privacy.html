                             TokensApp App ("TokensApp" or "we" or "us" or "our" or other similar pronouns), takes your privacy matters very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy ("Policy"). This Policy details how we receive, collect and use information in connection with our website located at tokensapp.com (the "Site" or “Sites”), the TokensApp Software ("TokensApp App"), and other products and services provided on the TokensApp.com website (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "Services").<br><br>
                             To be clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase "Personal Information" in this Policy, we mean information about you that is personally identifiable, like your name, address, e-mail address, billing information, or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with this personal information. When we use the phrase "Anonymous Information" in this Policy, we mean information that is not personally identifiable, or linked to your Personal Information such as aggregated information, general demographic information and IP addresses. Anonymous Information does not necessarily enable identification of individual persons.
                         </p>
                         <h3>1. Collection and Use of Information</h3>
                         <h2>TokensApp Application</h2>
                         <p>
                            When you install and register the TokensApp App, you will be asked to allow us access to your mobile device’s address book (collectively, "Personal Information") and provide us with your phone number.A copy of the phone numbers and names in your address book (but not emails, notes or any other personal information in your address book) will be stored on our servers and will only be used to:
                            <br><br>
                            (a) notify you when your contacts become active on TokensApp,
                            <br><br>
                            (b) indicate which of your contacts is already a TokensApp user,
                            <br><br>
                            In addition, we may also create a function in the future that will use this data to synchronize your address book across your multiple devices.
                            <br><br>
                            The copy of your address book (names and phones) is stored on a live database. This database does not have a "historical backup". If you delete the address book from our servers (more about this below), it will be deleted instantly and permanently.
                            <br><br>
                            Your phone number, which will be verified via a text message that will be sent to you, will be used for identification purposes as your TokensApp user ID.
                            <br><br>
                            TokensApp may interact with your phone's SMS inbox, placing incoming messages in your inbox or reading the contents of the activation SMS sent to you by TokensApp. WE WILL NOT ACCESS THE CONTENTS OF ANY OTHER SMS.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Chat messages</h2>
                        <p>
                            TokensApp stores text, audio, image, video and contact messages on our servers, until they are read by you (and thus, saved on your device), or until your account is terminated (more about this below).
                        </p>
                        <h2>Location Information</h2>
                        <p>
                            TokensApp allows you to attach your location information to messages you send to other users. If you choose to share your location with a specific user or group of users your location will be retrieved from your device and sent to TokensApp together with your message. TokensApp will only use this location for this particular purpose and delete it from its servers once the message is deleted (or once your account is terminated). For the avoidance of doubt, TokensApp will not share your location information and will not use it for any purpose except the one specifically requested by you.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Other Services</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the event we make message boards and forums available to you (collectively, "Forums"), you will be solely responsible for the information and any other content you post on and through these Forums and should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., name, e-mail address, telephone number) on or through these Forums, such information is generally accessible to, and may be collected and used by, other users. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties, and such messages are beyond our control. We do not exercise control over any users or Site visitors, and in no way are we responsible, and have any liability whatsoever, for any collection or use of information you may disclose through the Forums. This Policy does not cover such disclosure of information. You are encouraged to exercise discretion when providing personal information about yourself in and through Forums. Please do not post any personal information on this Site that you expect to keep private.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Cookies, Clear GIFs and Other Automatically Collected Data</h2>
                        <p>
                            If you have permitted your computer to accept cookies, we may use cookies on the Site. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier by saving preferences and browsing patterns while you are at the Site. Cookies may be used to analyze the Site usage, improve content, customize the Site's content and layout and for other customer service purposes. A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Site to other information about you, including your Personal Information. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Site. Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Site or certain areas or features of the Site.
                            <br><br>
                            We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, in the Site and/or in our communications with you to enable us to evaluate Site usage information about visitors to the Site, target campaigns, upgrade visitor information, and know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message. A clear gif may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.
                            <br><br>
                            Our servers may automatically collect data about your Internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you are on the Internet. When you request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and, if applicable, your domain name. Your IP Address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information about our members and users as a whole, but does not include personally identifiable information. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Site; the web site you visit after this Site; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Site or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our Services. Such information may also be used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.
                            <br><br>
                            We will not link any Personal Information, including e-mail addresses, with aggregate data of our users.
                            <br><br>
                            Any or all of these activities with regard to Site usage information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers, including, for example, our analytics vendor(s) and our e-mail management partner(s).
                        </p>
                        <h2>Third-Party Sites and Privacy Practices</h2>
                        <p>
                            You may arrive at our Site and/or download the TokensApp App from another website. In addition, our Site may contain links that will let you leave our Site and access another website. Websites linked to or from our Site are not under the control of TokensApp and it is possible that these websites have a different privacy policy.

                            Analytics Collection
                            We will never (and will not allow any third party to) use the statistical analytics tool to track or to collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of visitors or users. We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any Personally Identifiable Information from any source.

                        <h3>2. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h3>
                        <p>

                            We do not rent, sell, or share any information about the user with any third-parties. We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe such action is necessary to:
                            <br><br>
                            (a) comply with the law, or legal process served on us;
                            <br><br>
                            (b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or
                            <br><br>
                            (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our services or members of the public.
                            <br><br>
                            In order to provide you with TokensApp products you have requested, TokensApp may sometimes, if necessary, share your Personal Information (excluding your address book and related information) and traffic data with trusted partner service providers and/or agents, for example: banking organizations or other providers of payment and analytical services, customer support, or hosting services. TokensApp will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation. TokensApp will never share your address book information with any third party, except as may be required by law (see below).
                            <br><br>
                            The following is a description of how we may share your Personal Information with trusted third party partners. Should we add additional partners, we will immediately update this description:
                            <br><br>
                            1. We use two separate third party companies in order to send you an authentication SMS when you register with TokensApp. In order to send you the SMS, we send one of these third party companies your phone number and the authentication message. These third parties are contractually obligated to only use your phone number for the transmission of the authentication SMS.
                            <br><br>
                            2. We may use Push Notification Services to notify you about messages. These messages are sent to the push notification service provider, for delivery to your device.
                            <br><br>
                            Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the TokensApp servers that are used to store your Personal Information are owned and hosted by LeaseWeb Netherlands B.V.
                            <br><br>
                            We may disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance that disclosure of information is necessary.
                            <br><br>
                            We may from time to time ask you to provide information on your experiences which will be used to measure and improve quality. You are at no time under any obligation to provide any of such data. Any and all information which is voluntarily submitted in feedback forms on the Site or any survey that you accept to take part in is used for the purposes of reviewing this feedback and improving the TokensApp software, products and websites.
                            <br><br>
                            We may contact you to send you messages about faults and service issues. Furthermore, we reserve the right to use email, the TokensApp software or SMS to notify you of any eventual claims related to your use of our software, websites and/or products, including without limitation claims of violation of third party rights.
                            <br><br>
                            We may send you alerts via the TokensApp software to notify you when someone has tried to contact you. We may also use the TokensApp software to keep you up to date with news about our software and products that you have purchased and/or to inform you about other TokensApp products and related information.

Our systems and the communications networks through which you access our services may be subject to security breaches and failures which are due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If you have any questions regarding the security of your Personal Information, please contact our Privacy Officer.

                            In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. As part of such a transaction the new entity will be required to commit to the same level of protection of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we cannot obtain such a commitment, we will not perform the business transition.
                            <br><br>
                            We will post a notice on this Site of any such change in ownership or control of the Personal Information we may have prior to such transfer.
                        </p>
                        <h3>7. Changes to Policy</h3>
                        <p>
                            From time to time, we may revise this Policy. We reserve the right to update or modify this Policy, or any other of our policies or practices, at any time with or without notice. We will post the revised Policy on the Site, so that users can always be aware of what information we collect, how the information is used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed. You agree to review the Policy periodically so that you are aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the Site indicates your assent to any changes and signifies your agreement to the terms of our Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the Site, the TokensApp App, or any of the other Services.
                        </p>
                        <h3>8. Change or Removal of Information</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you provided your e-mail address to us and wish to update it, you may do so by sending an e-mail to support@tokensapp.com
                            <br><br>
                            If you no longer wish to receive e-mail communication from us, such as offers, updates and newsletters, you may opt-out of receiving such communications by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication. In addition, you can remove your e-mail address at any time by sending an e-mail with the subject line of UNSUBSCRIBE to support@tokensapp.com
                            <br><br>
                            Due to technological reasons, we do not know when and if you delete the application. Therefore, if we detect no activity from your device for 45 days, we will assume that you deleted the application and we will remove your address book from our servers. However, since we are not certain that you deleted the application (you may just be on vacation, etc.) we will not deactivate your TokensApp account (which is your phone number and device ID). We do not want to force you to register again in the event of non-use.
                            <br><br>
                            If you wish to delete your account completely, you can go to the Settings->Account in the TokensApp app, and tap the "Delete account" option. Please note that this will remove your data from TokensApp, and deactivate TokensApp on your device. If you have additional concerns and/or requests, you can contact TokensApp at support@tokensapp.com
                        </p>
