                             TokensApp App ("TokensApp" or "we" or "us" or "our" or other similar pronouns) offers users with mobile devices ("You") text messages services ("Services") transacted through a licensed application (“Licensed Application") for mobile devices. You understand that, just like when using regular mobile phone service, anyone with knowledge of your phone number may send you messages through our application. Our Licensed Application is licensed, not sold, to You for use only under the terms of this license, unless a product or service is accompanied by a separate license agreement, in which case the terms of that separate license agreement will govern, subject to Your prior acceptance of that separate license agreement. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to You.

                            This license granted to You for our Licensed Application is limited to a non-transferable license to use the Licensed Application on any mobile device that You own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in our Terms and Conditions (the “Usage Rules”). This license does not allow You to use the Licensed Application on any mobile device that You do not own or control, and You may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple mobile devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open sourced components included with the Licensed Application). Any attempt to do so is a violation of our rights. If You breach this restriction, You may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the license will govern any upgrades provided by us that replace and/or supplement our Services, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.
